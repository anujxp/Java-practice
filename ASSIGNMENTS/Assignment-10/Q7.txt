7)Can we make multiple contructor inside a class? if yes then what is the need of it.Explain,

Yes, we can have multiple constructors inside a class in Java. This concept is called Constructor Overloading.

What is Constructor Overloading?

It means defining more than one constructor in the same class, but with different parameter lists (different number or types of parameters).

Each constructor has the same name (which is the class name), but different signatures.

---------Why do we need multiple constructors?

Flexibility in Object Creation
--It allows creating objects in different ways depending on the available data.

--Improves Code Readability and Usability

Users of the class can choose the most appropriate constructor based on their needs.

Prevents the need to set properties separately after object creation.

Supports Different Initialization Scenarios

Sometimes, not all details are known upfront ; constructor overloading lets you provide partial or default values.


public class Book {
    private String title;
    private String author;
    private int year;

    // Constructor 1: No arguments (default constructor)
    public Book() {
        this.title = "Unknown";
        this.author = "Unknown";
        this.year = 0;
    }

    // Constructor 2: Title and author only
    public Book(String title, String author) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.year = 0;  // default year
    }

    // Constructor 3: All properties
    public Book(String title, String author, int year) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.year = year;
    }
}
