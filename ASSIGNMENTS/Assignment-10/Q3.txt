Getter and Setter methods are used in Java to access and update the values of private fields (variables) in a class.

Why Use Them?

Java follows the principle of encapsulation – hiding the internal state of an object and only allowing access through public methods.

1. Getter Method - Used to retrieve the value of a private field. Follows the naming pattern: getFieldName().

public class Person {
    private String name;

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }
}

Setter Method - Used to modify the value of a private field. Follows the naming pattern: setFieldName().

public class Person {
    private String name;

    public void setName(String newName) {
        this.name = newName;
    }
}


What is a POJO in Java?
POJO stands for Plain Old Java Object.
Definition:
A POJO is a simple Java object that doesn’t extend or implement any specialized classes or interfaces. It is used to represent data.
Characteristics of POJO:

1)No need to extend specific classes.

2)No annotations or business logic.

3)Uses private fields and public getter/setter methods.

4)Typically used in data transfer, ORM (e.g., Hibernate), or for modeling simple data.
