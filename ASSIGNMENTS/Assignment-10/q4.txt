To update and retrieve the value of a private property of an object from another class, we follow the concept of encapsulation in Java.

Since the property is marked as private, it is not directly accessible outside its own class. To interact with it, we use public getter and setter methods.
Encapsulation: We are protecting direct access to the field by making it private.

Getter and Setter: We are safely exposing the field to outside classes through public methods.

By using getter and setter methods, we follow object-oriented best practices and ensure that the class maintains control over how its internal data is accessed and modified.
