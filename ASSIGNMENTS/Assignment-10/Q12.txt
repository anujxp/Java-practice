12) Can we overload the method with var-arg type of argument.
Yes, we can overload methods that have var-arg (variable-length argument) parameters.

How Does It Work?

You can have multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists, where some may use varargs and others may use fixed arguments.

Varargs are treated as an array internally, so overloading must differ in a way that the compiler can clearly resolve which method to call.

However, be careful with ambiguity â€” if two overloaded methods can match the same call, the compiler will throw an error.

public class VarArgOverloading {

    // Method with fixed arguments
    public void display(int a, int b) {
        System.out.println("Method with two int parameters: " + a + ", " + b);
    }

    // Overloaded method with varargs
    public void display(int... numbers) {
        System.out.print("Method with varargs: ");
        for (int num : numbers) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VarArgOverloading obj = new VarArgOverloading();

        obj.display(10, 20);      // Calls method with two int parameters
        obj.display(1, 2, 3, 4);  // Calls method with varargs
    }
}
